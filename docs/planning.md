# Project Proposal

## Business Case

### Problem statement
We are aiming to build a web-app named Gastrella that allows users to engage by sharing reviews and comments so that even people with a restricted range of food can expand their palate without stepping out of their comfort zone. Our app gives recommendations based on these reviews, the location, and the food hygiene ratings database.
### Business benefits
- Helps local restaurants improve their visibility.
- Helps people with different preferences, cultures and diets discover new cuisines through personalized recommendations.
- People with disabilities may feel more included by creating new dining experiences.


### Options Considered
TODO: What are some other customer options or leading products that address the same needs?

### Expected Risks
- Financial risks: Not generating enough revenue
- Marketing competition: Differentiating our app
- Data security: Handling user data
- Lack of development expertise and time


## Project Scope
Our project includes the stages of data analysis and research, design, development and testing. It will cover the main pages and functionality required for user engagement, such as business rating options and feedback forms. But also excludes the maintenance process and updates post-launch.
